Eric Gass: Privacy policy
Welcome to Idle Grog Frontier

This is an Android app developed by Eric Gass

As an avid Android user myself, I take privacy very seriously. I know how irritating it is when apps collect your data without your knowledge.

Idle Grog Farm, does not take any private information from its users. It saves and reads only its own data. 

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any question regarding how the app protectes your privacy, please send me an email or post a discussion on GitHub, and I will surely try to fix it/help you.

Yours sincerely,
Eric Gass
